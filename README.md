# KCRL: Prior Knowledge Based Causal Discovery With Reinforcement Learning
This is the public repository of the code implementation for KCRL by Uzma Hasan and Md Osman Gani. We provide a codebase so that readers can reproduce our experiments.

## Requirements
The code is tested with the following configuration:

Python=3.6.10, numpy=1.18.1, pandas=1.0.1, scikit-learn=0.22.1, scipy=1.4.1, tensoflow=1.13.1, networkx, pyyaml=5.3, pytz=2019.3, matplotlib=3.1.3

## Acknowledgments
Our code has been benefited from the following existing works. We are really thankful to the corresponding authors.
